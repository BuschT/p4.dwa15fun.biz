In the root of your P4 app, include a file called README.md and include the following:

QuizTastic! is a basic testing/trivia system designed mainly for use on private systems such as company Intranets or within groups of friends.
It can be used to test serious subject matter or just as a fun brain teaser. The way it is currently designed allows for users to sign up and see all tests other users have created. 
Users may not view other user's scores. Each test may have up to 5 questions. Each question must have four multiple choice options.

Once you have taken a test, you can view your score, and you can always view it again using the View Scores page. You can never take the test again! All tests are saved forever for record-keeping purposes.
This means that you cannot delete questions or quizes you've created at this time.

Main features:

-- Create multiple choice quizes
-- Take multiple choice quizes either you or others have created
-- View your scores on  multiple choice quizes

Start by looking at some tests others have created, or create one of your own.

Javascript is used to manage user input in the fields. The form validation is all found in quiztastic.js. There was no other critical need for Javascript here; it is mainly used to prevent junk
getting into the database. There is also various error handling conditions in the PHP layer.


Have Fun!
